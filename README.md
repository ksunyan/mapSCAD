# MapSCAD Project
Build 3D printable choropleth maps from GeoJSON data. 

The `jsonscad_builder.py` Python module provides programmers with methods for: 
* Reading geographic data from GeoJSON files
* Binding statistical data to geographical areas
* Adjusting 3D model parameters
* Writing OpenSCAD code to a `.scad` file

**Note:** This guide assumes that you are comfortable with Python syntax (especially Python lists) and that you have at least a basic understanding of 3D printing and computer-aided design (CAD) concepts.

## Getting Started
Prior to using the `jsonscad_builder.py` module in your data visualization project, you will need to download and install some additional software.

### Python Dependencies
To simplify geometries, `jsonscad_builder.py` uses [an implementation of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker Algorithm](https://github.com/fhirschmann/rdp). Install this module using `pip`:
```
pip install rdp
```
### OpenSCAD
OpenSCAD is open-source software for creating solid 3D CAD models. Since OpenSCAD modeling is purely script-based, the software is ideal for creating parametric 3D models. You can get OpenSCAD from the project's [Downloads page](https://openscad.org/downloads.html). 

See the [OpenSCAD User Manual](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual) for more information.

### Slicer Software and STL Viewers
Since choice of slicer software for 3D printing largely depends on personal preference or compatibility with 3D printers, this guide will not address slicer software in detail. One popular slicer is [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) (which was used in testing of this project). 

Software for viewing `.stl` files may also be helpful. Free STL viewers are widely available online for download. 

## Example Code

### Overview of `example.py`
```python
import jsonscad_builder

bldr = jsonscad_builder.JsonScadBuilder()

bldr.read_json_file('County_Boundaries_of_NJ.geojson')

bldr.simplify()

county_populations = [
		['ATLANTIC', 274534], ['BERGEN', 955732], ['BURLINGTON', 461860],

### Step-by-Step Guide
This guide will explain the above `example.py` code. This guide will *not* provide a detailed description of all methods in the `JsonScadBuilder` class, nor will it include instructions on using OpenSCAD and slicer software to prepare the model for 3D printing.

For detailed information on `JsonScadBuilder` methods, see:

For a guide on the 3D printing process, see:

#### 1. Import the `json_scadbuilder` module and create a new `JsonScadBuilder` object
```python
import jsonscad_builder

bldr = jsonscad_builder.JsonScadBuilder()
```
In this example, the file `jsonscad_builder.py` is in the same directory as `example.py`. To create and initialize a new `JsonScadBuilder` object `bldr`, call its constructor. 

#### 2. Read GeoJSON data
```python
bldr.read_json_file('County_Boundaries_of_NJ.geojson')
```
In this example, the file `County_Boundaries_of_NJ.geojson` is in the same directory as `example.py`. The `read_json_file()` method takes the path to the file containing GeoJSON data as a parameter. If the method parses the file contents successfully, then the `bldr` object stores the data in an `OrderedDict`.

**Note:** The specified file can be any `.read()`-supporting text file or binary file containing a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`; conventional file extensions are `.geojson` and `.json`. See [RFC 7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946) for GeoJSON format standards. 

#### 3. Extract GeoJSON features
```python
bldr.extract_features()
```
You *must* call the `.extract_features()` function. `extract_features()` looks up the `'features'` array in the `OrderedDict` containing GeoJSON data. If the stored GeoJSON data is a `FeatureCollection`, the `extract_features()` will generate no error messages. In this example, each GeoJSON feature represents a New Jersey county.    

#### 4. Simplify
```python
bldr.simplify()
``` 
To reduce the number of points in the final 3D model, call the `simplify()` method. This method uses the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) Algorithm to calculate which points to preserve in the simplified geometries. `simplify()` has one optional parameter `eps`, which is the epsilon value in the RDP Algorithm. 


#### 5. Bind statistical data to GeoJSON features
```python
bldr.bind_data_by_identifier('population', county_populations, 'COUNTY')
```
The method `bind_data_by_identifier()` takes a list of data points (dataset) as one of its parameters. Each data point must be a key-value pair in list form (see the list `county_populations` in `example.py`). `bind_data_by_identifier()` attempts to add each data point in the dataset to its corresponding GeoJSON feature. To match data points to features, specify the member that you would like use as a unique identifier for each feature. In this example, the `'COUNTY` member (contained within each feature's `properties` member) is the chosen identifier.

**Note:** You can use an alternative method, `bind_data()`, to add data points *without* needing to specify an identifier. Instead, `bind_data()` requires that the data points are in the same order as features stored in `bldr`'s list of features. You should provide a flat list of values as the dataset.  

#### 6. Scale and translate geometries using `transform()`
```python
bldr.transform([-76.0, 38.6], 50)
````
In this example, the `transform()` method:
* Sets the coordinate `[-76.0, 38.6]` (Longitude: 76.0 W, Latitude: 38.6 N) as the origin (`[0,0,0]` in the OpenSCAD coordinate system) for the 3D model. 
* Scales the geometries to a reasonable size. Since the geographic area covered by the GeoJSON data is small (roughly 2.4 degrees of latitude), `transform()` multiplies the distances between points by the parameter `scale_factor`.

#### 7. Eliminate gaps between features using `offset()`
```python
bldr.offset(0.2)
```
The positive `offset_data` value signals `write_scad_file()` to draw all polygon geometries in OpenSCAD with sides offset by `offset_delta` from the original polygon geometries stored in `features`. Thus, in the OpenSCAD model, features will overlap by a small amount. These overlaps are good because they eliminate unwanted gaps between features.

#### 8. Scale extrusion heights using `scale_heights()`
```python
bldr.scale_heights([60000, 1000000],[3,12])
```
`scale_heights()` calculates each feature's extrusion height using the feature's bound statistical data value (which, from Step 5, is the population of the county). Provide an appropriate domain and range; the domain `[60000, 1000000]` covers population values for all New Jersey counties, and the range `[3, 12]` yields visually appealing height values for this 3D model.

#### 9. Write code to an OpenSCAD file
```python
bldr.write_scad_file('nj_populations.scad')
```
Finally, use `write_scad_file()` to generate an OpenSCAD file containing your 3D model. In this example, `write_scad_file()` creates a new file `nj_populations.scad` in the same directory as `example.py`. Now you can view the 3D model in OpenSCAD!

## Known Issues
OpenSCAD may occasionally generate the following error or warning messages:
* `WARNING: Object may not be a valid 2-manifold and may need repair!`
* `ERROR: The given mesh is not closed! Unable to convert to CGAL_Nef_Polyhedron.`

These messages indicate that the model contains one or more bad faces. I will need to determine whether this issue is due to the RDP Algorithm or other problems in the code.

## Project Rationale
Data visualization is powerful â€” it gives viewers the power to understand, analyze, or simply enjoy data. Conventional data visualization methods are confined to a flat surface, be it a monitor or a piece of paper. In a typical choropleth map, each geographical area's color depends on that area's value for some statistical variable that the map visualizes.

According to (Munzner, 2014), 3D-choropleth maps typically have a number of issues:
* Human length perception ability is accurate only for planar spatial position. Our ability to perceive depth is not nearly as accurate.
* Some 3D visualizations occlude important information. For instance, a particularly tall feature can prevent a viewer from seeing shorter features behind it.
* Perspective distortion (closer items appear larger, farther items appear smaller) makes comparing heights of features difficult. 
* In the real world, shadows and shading convey important information about depth, but a 3D visualization on screen or on paper cannot incorporate shadows or shading because doing so could distract the viewer or interfere with the coloring of features. 

However, these problems are the result of displaying 3D models in 2D space. On the contrary, the viewer of a tangible 3D model can quickly manipulate it, adjusting their view as they want. Thus, perspective distortion and occlusion are no longer significant problems. Lighting in the viewer's surroundings also casts natural shadows on and around the physical model.

3D printing technology enables creators of data visualizations to craft eye-catching pieces. A single 3D printed choropleth map, sitting on a desk, shelf, or windowsill, can prompt many meaningful discussions of its data. 

The goal of the MapSCAD project is to spark many of these conversations!
